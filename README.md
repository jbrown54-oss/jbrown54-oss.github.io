## Blog Integration

Blog posts can be:

2. Dynamically generated by the daily newsletter automation at 7pm
3. Viewed at `/blog/[slug]` where slug matches the post identifier

- **Neural Network**: Adjust node count, animation speed, and connection distance in `lib/neural-network.ts`
- **Social Links**: Update URLs in `components/SocialLinks.tsx`
- **Bio & Content**: Edit text in `app/page.tsx`

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Dynamic blog post loading from markdown files
